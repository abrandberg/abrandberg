### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a consultant within solid mechanics and structural analysis. I have a PhD from the department of Engineering Mechanics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I worked mostly on the solid mechanics of paper and paperboard. My group is led by professor [Artem Kulachenko](https://www.kth.se/profile/artem) and most of the repositories you will find here in some way contribute to the larger goal of the group.

You can get in contact with me via my employer, [Lightness by Design AB](https://lightness.eu/career/)

I host work related to my teaching on [my KTH profile page](https://www.kth.se/profile/augustbr).

My research articles can be found via [my orcid profile page](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5580-5023).

I also have a traditional resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustbrandberg/).
