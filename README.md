### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a PhD student at the department of Engineering Mechanics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I work mostly on the solid mechanics of paper and paperboard. My group is led by professor [Artem Kulachenko](https://www.kth.se/profile/artem) and most of the repositories you will find here in some way contribute to the larger goal of the group.

I host work related to my teaching on [my KTH profile page](https://www.kth.se/profile/augustbr).

My research articles can be found via [my orcid profile page](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5580-5023).

I also have a traditional resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustbrandberg/).
